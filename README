Ocamlyices: An Ocaml binding for Yices 1, version 0.2
Mickaël Delahaye

* Requirement

- Yices >= 1.0.26 < 2 <http://yices.csl.sri.com>
  with or without GMP statically linked
  libyices.a or libyices.a must be installed on the system
  
  You can use './install-yices.sh yices.tar.gz' to install yices in /usr/local
  and register the DLL

- GMP and GMP header <gmp.h>

- Camlidl

- For deveoppers, to use the latest version from the repository: autoconf

* Install

$ autoconf # Only if there is no configure
$ ./configure

$ make

Build the Ocamlyices library (for ocamlopt and ocamlc).

Part of the linking is done by an incremental, partial, linking, the rest is
done by ocamlc or ocamlopt when you use the Ocamlyices library.

Not-so-hidden make options you should not normally use:

CUSTOM=y
  Use a "custom" bytecode compilation (see Ocamlc manual).
FORCE_STATIC=y
  Force the use of libyices.a instead of libyices.so (must be use in combination
  with CUSTOM for bytecode).
NO_PARTIAL_LINKING=y
  Do not use partial linking, not compatible with FORCE_STATIC (to obtain this
  behavior just delete libyices.so).

$ sudo make install

Install the library in `ocamlc -where`/ocamlyices

* Usage

ocamlc -I +ocamlyices nums.cma ocamlyices.cma ...
ocamlopt -I +ocamlyices nums.cmxa ocamlyices.cmxa ...

nums is required in order to handle GMP big integers as big_int.

* WARNING

Hardly tested! and only under Linux, but reported to work under MacOS X...
